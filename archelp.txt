Welcome To Arc Tutor, Here We Will Help You Learn ArcLang Programming Language.

What is Arclang?
  ArcLang is an interpretor based language, runs during realtime and isnt compiled.
  ArcLang can be ran inside the terminal, 
  or write a file with the file extention of ".al" and pass it as an argument to run it.\

    How To Write ArcLang:


    Lesson 1: Defining a variable

    - variables can be defined in ways that tend to the usage you need.
    different variable keywords are responsible for diffderent attributes.

    1. set
    - set is the original variable keyword and is used for mutable variables.
    - you can assign a variable type for this, if no type is assigned,
    it will default to a string.
    - no quotes are required since, we use types and symbols to diffrenciate

    with this example below, we have created some variables for a user

    ```alang
    set name = user;str
    set age = 37;int
    set isMale = true;bool
    set classes = ["CS","Math","Physics"];arr
    ```

    2. const
    - consts are the immutable versions of 'set'
    - once a variable is defined using 'const' it cannot be changed in runtime
    - follows the same rules as 'set', except its immutable

    ```alang
    const name = user;str
    const age = 37;int
    const isMale = true;bool
    const classes = ["CS","Math","Physics"];arr
    ```

    3. let
    - let is the undefined variable keyword
    - let is used for mutable variables
    - let is used for variables that are not defined yet; that will be expecting a value
    - let does not have an auto type detect
    - a type needs to be assigned for this variable to be used correctly or else it will error

    ```alang
    let name;str
    let age;int
    let isMale;bool
    let classes;arr
    ```

    Lesson 2: Interacting with the user through the console

    1. stdout
    - stdout is used to print to the console
    - stdout can be used to print any type of variable or string that is defined
    - does not require a type
    - aggregates everything so no need for quotes

    - to print variables, you need to add the question mark symbol at the start

    ```alang
    ?name # will print the value of name
    ````

    ```alang
    stdout ?name
    stdout ?age
    stdout ?isMale
    stdout ?classes
    ```

    2. stdin
    - stdin is used to take an input from the console
    - stdin defined a variable that the input on the console will store
    - requires a type to be assigned, will be the expected types

    follow this format
    ```alang
    stdin {variablename};{type} {prompt}
    ```

    the prompt will be aggregated so no need for quotes

    ```alang
    stdin userAge;int what is your age?
    ```

  Lesson 3: Math and logic
  - mathematical operators can be used in Arclang to evalute logic and math
  - all operations and logic is evaluated from left to right (no bedmas)
  - all logic is ecaluated inside parenthesis

  - to set a variable to be the output of a math expression, types arent required
  ```alang
  set sum = (2 + 2)
  const PiE = ( 3.14 + 2.17 )
  set isEven = (6 % 2)
  ```
